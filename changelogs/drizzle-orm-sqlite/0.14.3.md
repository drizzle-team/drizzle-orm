# drizzle-orm-sqlite 0.14.3

- `RangeError: The supplied SQL string contains more than one statement` error on migrations was fixed

    Created `.exec()` method for session, that will run query without prepared statments

- Fix `defaultNow()` method query generation by adding missin `"()"`.

    Previously default value was generated as 
    ```sql
    cast((julianday('now') - 2440587.5)*86400000 as integer)
    ``` 
    
    Currently default value looks like
    ```sql
    (cast((julianday('now') - 2440587.5)*86400000 as integer))
    ```

- Create test cases for both issues
