# SingleStore `push` and `generate` improvements

As SingleStore did not support certain DDL statements before this release, you might encounter an error indicating that some schema changes cannot be applied due to a database issue. Starting from this version, drizzle-kit will detect such cases and initiate table recreation with data transfer between the tables

# Bug fixes

- [[BUG] If the index name is the same as the generated name, it will be empty and a type error will occur](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/3420)
