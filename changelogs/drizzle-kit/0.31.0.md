## Features and improvements

### Enum DDL improvements

For situations where you drop an `enum` value or reorder values in an `enum`, there is no native way to do this in PostgreSQL. To handle these cases, `drizzle-kit` used to:

- Change the column data types from the enum to text
- Drop the old enum
- Add the new enum
- Change the column data types back to the new enum

However, there were a few scenarios that weren’t covered: `PostgreSQL` wasn’t updating default expressions for columns when their data types changed

Therefore, for cases where you either change a column’s data type from an `enum` to some other type, drop an `enum` value, or reorder `enum` values, we now do the following:

- Change the column data types from the enum to text
- Set the default using the ::text expression
- Drop the old enum
- Add the new enum
- Change the column data types back to the new enum
- Set the default using the ::<new_enum> expression

### `esbuild` version upgrade
