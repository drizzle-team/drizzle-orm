## Breaking changes

### The `migrations`.`prefix` field was removed from `drizzle-kit` config
The following syntax is now deprecated:
```ts
migrations: {
    prefix: 'index'
}
```
You can no longer use it to define your `drizzle.config.ts` file like this:
```ts {11-13}
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit";

export default defineConfig({
  dialect: "postgresql",
  schema: "./schema.ts",
  out: "./drizzle",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
  },
  // ❌ deprecated, will be removed
  migrations: {
    prefix: 'index'
  }
});
```
There is no alternatives for `prefix` at the moment.
We will consider adding one in the future for compatibility with some providers.
