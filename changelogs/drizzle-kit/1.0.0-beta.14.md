## Migrator update
The migrator now applies all changes that are missing in the database. Previously the migrator only looked for local migrations with a creation date later than the last migration applied in the database
Now it detects and applies all missing migrations

- Fixed `generate` and `pull` commands to display the `SQL file` instead of the `folder` path in the migration output message
> Your SQL migration ➜ <path>
