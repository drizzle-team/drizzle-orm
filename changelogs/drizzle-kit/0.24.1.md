## Bug fixes

> Big thanks to @L-Mario564 for his [PR](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/pull/2804). It conflicted in most cases with a PR that was merged, but we incorporated some of his logic. Merging it would have caused more problems and taken more time to resolve, so we just took a few things from his PR, like removing "::<type>" mappings in introspect and some array type default handlers

### What was fixed

1. The Drizzle Kit CLI was not working properly for the `introspect` command.
2. Added the ability to use column names with special characters for all dialects.
3. Included PostgreSQL sequences in the introspection process.
4. Reworked array type introspection and added all test cases.
5. Fixed all (we hope) default issues in PostgreSQL, where `::<type>` was included in the introspected output.
6. `preserve` casing option was broken
