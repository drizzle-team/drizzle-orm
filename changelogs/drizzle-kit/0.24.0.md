## Breaking changes (for SQLite users)

#### Fixed [Composite primary key order is not consistent](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-kit-mirror/issues/342) by removing `sort` in SQLite and to be consistant with the same logic in PostgreSQL and MySQL

The issue that may arise for SQLite users with any driver using composite primary keys is that the order in the database may differ from the Drizzle schema.

- If you are using `push`, you **MAY** be prompted to update your table with a new order of columns in the composite primary key. You will need to either change it manually in the database or push the changes, but this may lead to data loss, etc.

- If you are using `generate`, you **MAY** also be prompted to update your table with a new order of columns in the composite primary key. You can either keep that migration or skip it by emptying the SQL migration file.

If nothing works for you and you are blocked, please reach out to me @AndriiSherman. I will try to help you!
