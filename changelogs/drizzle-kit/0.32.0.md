# Improvements

## Updates Zod version from v3 to v4

Upgrades the zod dependency from v3 to v4 while remaining backward compatible with previous versions.

### Deprecated `.strict()` method has been omitted from modernisation steps 

`.strict()` is the only functionality to be skipped when modernising the code utilising zod. This is because the rewrite 
of drizzle-kit in #4439 may mean this work is discarded in later releases. `.strict()` requires quite a bit of work to
align it with the v4 API and doing so will also void backward compatibility.
