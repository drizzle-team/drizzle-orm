## Bug fixes

- [[BUG]:drizzle-kit pull generates incorrect schema for functional/computed index](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/5224)
- [[BUG]: drizzle-kit pull generates invalid code for MySQL datetime with DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/5212)
- [[BUG]: Drizzle-kit - push tries to delete non-public schemas by default (pscale_extensions)](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/5190)
- [[BUG]: JSON.stringify cannot serialize BigInt](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/5227)

- Commutativity for `MySQL` `now(N)` and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(N)`

**MySQL pull command**:
- Creation of a primary key when a column had only `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL`
- `varbinary()` config was ignored in a ts schema file
- Foreign key column duplication when constraint names matched across multiple databases
- Inconsistent casing between `schema.ts` and `relations.ts`
- Cyclic references are generated as inline `.references((): AnyMySqlColumn => ...)` to avoid type errors for single-column references

**Common**:
- Relation name collisions with column names during introspection. If a relation name collides with a column name - the relation is renamed to `<name>Relation`
