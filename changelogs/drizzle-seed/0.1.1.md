# Initial Release

> [!NOTE]
> `drizzle-seed` can only be used with `drizzle-orm@0.36.4` or higher. Versions lower than this may work at runtime but could have type issues and identity column issues, as this patch was introduced in `drizzle-orm@0.36.4`

## Full Reference

The full API reference and package overview can be found in our [official documentation](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/seed-overview)

## Basic Usage

In this example we will create 10 users with random names and ids

```ts {12}
import { pgTable, integer, text } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/node-postgres";
import { seed } from "drizzle-seed";

const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: integer().primaryKey(),
  name: text().notNull(),
});

async function main() {
  const db = drizzle(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
  await seed(db, { users });
}

main();
```

## Options

**`count`**

By default, the `seed` function will create 10 entities.
However, if you need more for your tests, you can specify this in the seed options object

```ts
await seed(db, schema, { count: 1000 });
```

**`seed`**

If you need a seed to generate a different set of values for all subsequent runs, you can define a different number
in the `seed` option. Any new number will generate a unique set of values

```ts
await seed(db, schema, { seed: 12345 });
```
