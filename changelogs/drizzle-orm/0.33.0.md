## Breaking changes (for some of postgres.js users)

#### Bugs fixed for this breaking change

- [Open
[BUG]: jsonb always inserted as a json string when using postgres-js](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/724)
- [[BUG]: jsonb type on postgres implement incorrectly](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1511)

> As we are doing with other drivers, we've changed the behavior of PostgreSQL-JS to pass raw JSON values, the same as you see them in the database. So if you are using the PostgreSQL-JS driver and passing data to Drizzle elsewhere, please check the new behavior of the client after it is passed to Drizzle.

> We will update it to ensure it does not override driver behaviors, but this will be done as a complex task for everything in Drizzle in other releases

If you were using `postgres-js` with `jsonb` fields, you might have seen stringified objects in your database, while drizzle insert and select operations were working as expected.

You need to convert those fields from strings to actual JSON objects. To do this, you can use the following query to update your database:

**if you are using jsonb:**
```sql
update table_name
set jsonb_column = (jsonb_column #>> '{}')::jsonb;
```

**if you are using json:**
```sql
update table_name
set json_column = (json_column #>> '{}')::json;
```

We've tested it in several cases, and it worked well, but only if all stringified objects are arrays or objects. If you have primitives like strings, numbers, booleans, etc., you can use this query to update all the fields

**if you are using jsonb:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET jsonb_column = CASE
    -- Convert to JSONB if it is a valid JSON object or array
    WHEN jsonb_column #>> '{}' LIKE '{%' OR jsonb_column #>> '{}' LIKE '[%' THEN
        (jsonb_column #>> '{}')::jsonb
    ELSE
        jsonb_column
END
WHERE
    jsonb_column IS NOT NULL;
```

**if you are using json:**
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET json_column = CASE
    -- Convert to JSON if it is a valid JSON object or array
    WHEN json_column #>> '{}' LIKE '{%' OR json_column #>> '{}' LIKE '[%' THEN
        (json_column #>> '{}')::json
    ELSE
        json_column
END
WHERE json_column IS NOT NULL;
```
