## Improvements

LibSQL migrations have been updated to utilize batch execution instead of transactions. As stated in the [documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/sdk/ts/reference#batch-transactions), LibSQL now supports batch operations

> A batch consists of multiple SQL statements executed sequentially within an implicit transaction. The backend handles the transaction: success commits all changes, while any failure results in a full rollback with no modifications.
