- Drizzle now has native `@effect/sql-pg` driver support  
That is a big milestone for Drizzle. We did rework our query builder chain and it supports both EffectLike and PromiseLike flows, we will gather feedback from the community and ship other dialects support  
- We did also rework(simplified) `PgColumn` type chain, it's now mostly decoupled from other dialects, it now has better type performance and simpler declaration chain. We did remove PgArray column recursive wrapper, every `PgColumn` now has dimensions property both in runtime and type chain for external usage like validation packages
- We have 1 breaking API change too, postgres `.array()` is now not chainable, if you want to have multidimensional array it's now `.array('[][]')`,`.array('[][][]')`, etc.  
- Fixed lack of query result recalculation on pg dynamic update with joins  
- Switched `MySQL2` default client from `CallbackPool` to `Pool`
