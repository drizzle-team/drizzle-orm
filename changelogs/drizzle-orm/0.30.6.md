## New Features

### ðŸŽ‰ PGlite driver Support

PGlite is a WASM Postgres build packaged into a TypeScript client library that enables you to run Postgres in the browser, Node.js and Bun, with no need to install any other dependencies. It is only 2.6mb gzipped.

It can be used as an ephemeral in-memory database, or with persistence either to the file system (Node/Bun) or indexedDB (Browser).

Unlike previous "Postgres in the browser" projects, PGlite does not use a Linux virtual machine - it is simply Postgres in WASM.

Usage Example
```ts
import { PGlite } from '@electric-sql/pglite';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/pglite';

// In-memory Postgres
const client = new PGlite();
const db = drizzle(client);

await db.select().from(users);
```

There are currently 2 limitations, that should be fixed on Pglite side:

- [Attempting to refresh a materialised view throws error](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite/issues/63)

- [Attempting to SET TIME ZONE throws error](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite/issues/62)
