# ESM support

- 🎉 Added ESM support! You can now use `drizzle-orm` in both ESM and CJS environments.
- 🎉 Added code minification and source maps.
- ❗ Removed several nested import paths. Most notably, everything from `drizzle-orm/sql` and `drizzle-orm/expressions` should now be imported from `drizzle-orm` instead.
