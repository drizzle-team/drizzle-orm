## Features

- Added `cross join` \([#1414](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1414)\)
- Added lateral `left`, `inner`, `cross` joins to `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, `Gel`, `SingleStore`
- Added drizzle connection attributes to `SingleStore`'s driver instances  

## Fixes

- Removed unsupported by dialect `full join` from `MySQL` select api  
- Forced `Gel` columns to always have explicit schema & table prefixes due to potential errors caused by lack of such prefix in subquery's selection when there's already a column bearing same name in context  
- Added missing export for `PgTextBuilderInitial` type  
- Removed outdated `IfNotImported` type check from `SingleStore` driver initializer  
- Fixed incorrect type inferrence for insert and update models with non-strict `tsconfig`s \([#2654](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/2654)\)  
- Fixed invalid spelling of `nowait` flag \([#3554](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/3554)\)
