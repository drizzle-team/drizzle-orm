# Improvements

## Migrates zod to v4

The following impacts have been addressed to support the migration to zod v4 for the packages: drizzle-zod and drizzle-kit

### Changes

**drizzle-zod** (v0.8.0)
 - peerDependencies: `"zod": ">=4.0.0"`
 - devDependencies: `"zod": "^4.1.1"`
 - Files: drizzle-zod/package.json:68,79

**drizzle-kit** (v0.32.0)
 - devDependencies: `"zod": "^4.1.12"`
 - Files: drizzle-kit/package.json:116
 - Heavy internal usage in validation and serialization modules

**drizzle-orm** (v0.40.0)
 - devDependencies: `"zod": "^4.0.0"`
 - Files: drizzle-orm/package.json:204

**integration-tests**
 - dependencies: `"zod": "^4.1.1"`
 - Files: integration-tests/package.json:79

**examples/libsql**
 - dependencies: `"zod": "^4.1.1"`
 - Files: examples/libsql/package.json:22
 - Updated Dependencies: `@hono/zod-validator: ^0.4.1`, `znv: ^0.5.0`

### Out of date package-lock.json regeneration

These examples had zod 3.x references in their package-lock.json files from transitive dependencies. All lock files have been regenerated.

Note: These examples don't directly depend on zod. The old zod 3.x references were from transitive dependencies through drizzle-kit. After regenerating lock files, they now pull the latest drizzle-kit which uses Zod 4.x.

**examples/pg-proxy**
 - package-lock.json

**examples/mysql-proxy**
 - package-lock.json

**examples/better-sqlite3**
 - package-lock.json

**examples/aws-lambda**
 - package-lock.json
