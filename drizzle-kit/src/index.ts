/**
 * **You are currently using version 0.21.0+ of drizzle-kit. If you have just upgraded to this version, please make sure to read the changelog to understand what changes have been made and what
 * adjustments may be necessary for you. See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/upgrade-21#how-to-migrate-to-0210**
 *
 * **Config** usage:
 *
 * `dialect` - mandatory and is responsible for explicitly providing a databse dialect you are using for all the commands
 * *Possible values*: `postgresql`, `mysql`, `sqlite`
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#dialect
 *
 * ---
 * `schema` - param lets you define where your schema file/files live.
 * You can have as many separate schema files as you want and define paths to them using glob or array of globs syntax.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#schema
 *
 * ---
 * `out` - allows you to define the folder for your migrations and a folder, where drizzle will introspect the schema and relations
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#out
 *
 * ---
 * `driver` - optional param that is responsible for explicitly providing a driver to use when accessing a database
 * *Possible values*: `aws-data-api`, `d1-http`, `expo`, `turso`, `pglite`
 * If you don't use AWS Data API, D1, Turso or Expo - ypu don't need this driver. You can check a driver strategy choice here: https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/upgrade-21
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#driver
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `dbCredentials` - an object to define your connection to the database. For more info please check the docs
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#dbcredentials
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `migrations` - param let’s use specify custom table and schema(PostgreSQL only) for migrations.
 * By default, all information about executed migrations will be stored in the database inside
 * the `__drizzle_migrations` table, and for PostgreSQL, inside the drizzle schema.
 * However, you can configure where to store those records.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#migrations
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `breakpoints` - param lets you enable/disable SQL statement breakpoints in generated migrations.
 * It’s optional and true by default, it’s necessary to properly apply migrations on databases,
 * that do not support multiple DDL alternation statements in one transaction(MySQL, SQLite) and
 * Drizzle ORM has to apply them sequentially one by one.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#breakpoints
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `tablesFilters` - param lets you filter tables with glob syntax for db push command.
 * It’s useful when you have only one database avaialable for several separate projects with separate sql schemas.
 *
 * How to define multi-project tables with Drizzle ORM — see https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/goodies#multi-project-schema
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#tablesfilters
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `schemaFilter` - parameter allows you to define which schema in PostgreSQL should be used for either introspect or push commands.
 * This parameter accepts a single schema as a string or an array of schemas as strings.
 * No glob pattern is supported here. By default, drizzle will use the public schema for both commands,
 * but you can add any schema you need.
 *
 * For example, having schemaFilter: ["my_schema"] will only look for tables in both the database and
 * drizzle schema that are a part of the my_schema schema.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#schemafilter
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `verbose` - command is used for drizzle-kit push commands and prints all statements that will be executed.
 *
 * > Note: This command will only print the statements that should be executed.
 * To approve them before applying, please refer to the `strict` command.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#verbose
 *
 * ---
 *
 * `strict` - command is used for drizzle-kit push commands and will always ask for your confirmation,
 * either to execute all statements needed to sync your schema with the database or not.
 *
 * See https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/config-reference#strict
